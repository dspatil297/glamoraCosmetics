3. Pack the product securely and ship it to the address we provide. We recommend using a trackable service.
4. Once we receive and inspect the product, we will process your refund or replacement.

## Refunds

- Approved refunds will be issued to the original payment method within [e.g. 7–10] business days after we receive the returned item.
- Shipping costs (for returns) may be non-refundable unless the return is due to our error (e.g. wrong or defective product).
- For COD orders, refund will be processed via bank transfer or another method we communicate to you.

## Exchanges

- If you need a different variant or product, you may return the original (per above) and place a new order, or we may arrange an exchange where feasible.
