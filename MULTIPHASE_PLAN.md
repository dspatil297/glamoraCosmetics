# Glamora Cosmetics (Dawn) — Multiphase Development Plan (beminimalist structure)

This plan implements the page structure documented in `beminimalist-page-structures.md` (global announcement bar + header/footer shell, and the homepage section order/blocks), while keeping Shopify/Dawn core functionality intact.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Brand**: Glamora Cosmetics  
**Industry**: Cosmetics / Skincare  
**Theme foundation**: Shopify Dawn (Liquid + JSON templates + sections)  
**Primary goal (current)**: Match beminimalist-style structure + design first (content + sections), keep functionality stable.

---

## 📋 Phase 1: Brand System + Global Tokens (Design Foundation)

- [ ] **Fonts + typography**: confirm brandkit fonts across the theme (headings + body).
- [ ] **Theme tokens**: CSS variables for primary/secondary/accent, text, borders, radii, shadows.
- [ ] **Global spacing/layout**: container widths, section padding rhythm, mobile breakpoints.
- [ ] **Component baseline**: buttons, chips, cards, inputs (so collection + PDP match later).

**Definition of Done**
- Site looks consistently Glamora across all pages (even before page-specific polish).

---

## 📋 Phase 2: Global Layout Shell (match beminimalist global UI)

Based on `beminimalist-page-structures.md` “GLOBAL LAYOUT” + “GLOBAL UI OVERLAYS”.

- [x] **Announcement bar (rotating)**: `sections/announcement-bar.liquid` wired into `sections/header-group.json`.
- [ ] **Header nav structure**:
  - Desktop: logo + nav links + search + account + cart count
  - Mobile: left slide-in menu with nested levels
- [ ] **Search overlay**: full-screen, popular searches, quick results.
- [ ] **Cart drawer**: right slide-in, free-gift/progress messaging, subtotal + checkout CTA.
- [ ] **Country selector modal** (later): only if you truly need multi-country.
- [ ] **Cookie banner** (later): only if legally required for your target markets.

**Definition of Done**
- Global shell matches the beminimalist interaction model on desktop + mobile.

---

## 📋 Phase 3: Homepage (match beminimalist section order)

Based on `beminimalist-page-structures.md` “HOMEPAGE `/`”.

### Section order (implemented in `templates/index.json`)

- [x] **Loyalty program banner**: `sections/loyalty-banner.liquid`
- [x] **App download banner**: `sections/promo-banner.liquid`
- [x] **Notice strip** (GST/info): `sections/notice-strip.liquid`

### Content wiring checklist (Theme Editor)
- [ ] Upload banner images for **bundle / AI / loyalty / app** sections
- [ ] Point tile links to real **collections** (Skin, Hair, etc.) and **concern collections**
- [ ] Create collections with the expected handles (ex: `new-launches`, `best-sellers`) or change handles in Theme Editor

**Definition of Done**

## 📋 Glamora Cosmetics – Phase 1: Brand & Theme Setup (Dawn)

> This section adapts the existing multiphase plan for the Glamora Cosmetics Shopify theme using the Dawn base theme. It focuses on design-only changes so existing functionality remains intact.

### 1.1 Load Glamora Fonts in `theme.liquid`

- [ ] Open `layout/theme.liquid` and, inside the `<head>` tag, add the Glamora font imports:

```liquid
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cormorant+Garamond:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Lato:wght@300;400;500;700&family=Montserrat:wght@500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

### 1.2 Add Glamora Theme Settings in `config/settings_schema.json`

- [ ] In `config/settings_schema.json`, add Glamora-specific color settings inside the main `"settings"` array:

```json
{
  "name": "Glamora Theme",
  "settings": [
    {
      "type": "color",
      "id": "glamora_primary",
      "label": "Glamora primary (rose gold)",
      "default": "#C4896F"
    },
    {
      "type": "color",
      "id": "glamora_secondary",
      "label": "Glamora secondary (warm blush)",
      "default": "#F2D4C8"
    },
    {
      "type": "color",
      "id": "glamora_accent",
      "label": "Glamora accent (champagne gold)",
      "default": "#D4AF87"
    },
    {
      "type": "color",
      "id": "glamora_bg",
      "label": "Background (cream white)",
      "default": "#FAF7F4"
    },
    {
      "type": "color",
      "id": "glamora_alt_bg",
      "label": "Alt section background (soft ivory)",
      "default": "#F5EDE6"
    },
    {
      "type": "color",
      "id": "glamora_text",
      "label": "Text (charcoal)",
      "default": "#2C2C2C"
    },
    {
      "type": "color",
      "id": "glamora_text_muted",
      "label": "Muted text (warm gray)",
      "default": "#7A7A7A"
    },
    {
      "type": "color",
      "id": "glamora_button",
      "label": "CTA button (dark rose)",
      "default": "#A0614A"
    },
    {
      "type": "color",
      "id": "glamora_button_hover",
      "label": "CTA hover (deep burgundy)",
      "default": "#7A3D2E"
    }
  ]
}
```

> Note: merge these into your existing theme section; do not duplicate `"settings"` roots.

### 1.3 Wire Glamora Tokens into Global CSS (`assets/base.css` or `theme.css`)

- [ ] Near the top of your main CSS asset, define Glamora variables using the new settings:

```css
:root {
  --glamora-primary: {{ settings.glamora_primary }};
  --glamora-secondary: {{ settings.glamora_secondary }};
  --glamora-accent: {{ settings.glamora_accent }};
  --glamora-bg: {{ settings.glamora_bg }};
  --glamora-alt-bg: {{ settings.glamora_alt_bg }};
  --glamora-text: {{ settings.glamora_text }};
  --glamora-text-muted: {{ settings.glamora_text_muted }};
  --glamora-button: {{ settings.glamora_button }};
  --glamora-button-hover: {{ settings.glamora_button_hover }};

  --glamora-radius-button: 4px;
  --glamora-radius-card: 10px;
  --glamora-shadow-card: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.07);

  --glamora-font-heading: "Cormorant Garamond", serif;
  --glamora-font-body: "Lato", system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif;
  --glamora-font-label: "Montserrat", system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--glamora-bg);
  color: var(--glamora-text);
  font-family: var(--glamora-font-body);
  line-height: 1.7;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-family: var(--glamora-font-heading);
  color: var(--glamora-text);
}

.button,
.button--primary,
.shopify-payment-button__button {
  background-color: var(--glamora-button);
  color: #fff;
  border-radius: var(--glamora-radius-button);
  letter-spacing: 0.12em;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-family: var(--glamora-font-label);
}

.button:hover,
.button--primary:hover,
.shopify-payment-button__button:hover {
  background-color: var(--glamora-button-hover);
}

.card,
.product-card,
.collection-card {
  border-radius: var(--glamora-radius-card);
  box-shadow: var(--glamora-shadow-card);
  background-color: #fff;
}

.section {
  padding-top: 80px;
  padding-bottom: 80px;
}
```
